# ECE5990_RaspberryPi_HUD
For this project we decided to build a heads up display for cars using a Raspberry Pi 2. We wanted to interface with the car so we employed the usage of a Bluetooth OBDII dongle that was able to capture vital car diagnostic information in real time. We also implemented an IMU unit Adafruit LSM9DS0 directly onto the Raspberry Pi. The IMU contained various sensors including a accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and a potentially faulty embedded temperature sensor. After capturing the information we needed from the OBDII and IMU, we implemented a GUI for the 2.8 inch Raspberry Pi TFT screen and displayed all information accordingly.
